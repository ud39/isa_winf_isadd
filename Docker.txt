1. change IP to current docker IP in ClientApp/src/app/global.ts  property: "url"

2. change in appsettings.json  Host:localhost to Host:db for "DefaultConnection" and "ConnectionString"

3. Comment line 155 " app.UseHttpsRedirection(); " - Doesn't work for docker yet

4. "docker-compose up -d"Errorhandling: "npm ERR! File exists: /app/ClientApp/node_modules/.bin/uuid

 npm ERR! Move it away, and try again."

-> Delete folder /app/ClientApp/node_modules (bearbeitet)
